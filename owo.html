<p> 
	An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction.

		<li class="meow", id="rea"> Reasons
			<br>
			<span> There are quite a few reason for how more and more species are being endangered and in risk of extinction </span>
			<ul>
				<li>Habitat loss </li>
				<li>Harmful non-native species introduced </li>
				<li>Pollution</li>
				<li>Diseases</li>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Mainly all of these are caused by us human, we build more houses and therefore create deforestation, taking away their habitat. We bring new species from the other side of the world back to us to make money, accidentally having them kill all the local species. We create more and more pollution as we live and profit, poisoning the environment. We made the environment so tough that viruses evolve, so fast to the point that they can now kills the species that they couldn't before.

			Examples
			<ul>
				<li>
					Polar Bear
					<p>
						They're dying of the ice melting due to global warming, slowly forcing them to move to the warm land, killing most of them in the process.

				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					Snow Leopard
					<!-- cat -->
					<p>
						Poaching, habitat loss, declines in natural prey species, and retaliatory killings resulting from human-wildlife conflict are the main reasons this big cat is under threat.

			What to do
			<p> You can simply help most of the current endangered species by decrease your pollution rate, not buying products made from endangered species. This can't be stop just from an individual effort, but together, we can do this and we can preserve the diversity of species on earth, keeping the beauty of nature as it is.
